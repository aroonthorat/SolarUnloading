# How to Run the New Admin Dashboard

Since we have moved the Admin Dashboard from HTML to Flutter, you need to run the Flutter app.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies
Open your **Terminal** (in VS Code: Terminal -> New Terminal) and run:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Run the App
For the best Admin Dashboard experience, run it on **Chrome** (Web) or **Windows**:

**For Web (Recommended):**
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

**For Windows:**
```bash
flutter run -d windows
```

## Troubleshooting
If you see `flutter: command not found`, make sure you have the Flutter SDK installed and added to your system PATH.
